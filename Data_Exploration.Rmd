# Data Exploration

"There is no routine statistical questions only questionable statistical routines." 

Sir David Cox.

Even though there aren't routine questions, there are 2 questions that generally help.
* What is the type of variation within my variables?
* What type of covariation are there between my variables?

##Distributions of a Single Variable

For Categorical variables use a bar plot.

```{r barplot}

ggplot(data=diamonds)+
  geom_bar(mapping=aes(x=cut, fill=cut))

```

For Continuous variables use histograms (geom histogram) or frequency plots (geom freqpoly).

```{r histogram1}

ggplot(data=diamonds)+
  geom_histogram(mapping=aes(x=carat), binwidth = 0.5)

```

```{r histogram2}

```
